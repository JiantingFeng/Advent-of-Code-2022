## Hi, there

This is my solution for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in C++ (mostly)

## Usage

For example, when you want to run my solution of day 1, you can run

```shell
clang++ -std=c++17 -O2 ./1.cpp | ./a.out < 1.in
```

Some problems are solved in python for simplicity of code, you can use **pypy**.
